        <h1>Scout UW</h1>
        A whole new way to discover the UW

        <p>This fall, Scout UW will revolutionize how you find the stuff you need on campus, when you need them.</p>

        <p>Looking for?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A place to study? Scout helps you browse study spots without having to walk all over campus.</li>
            <li>Food?  Discover new places to eat on campus based on cuisine, location and more.</li>
            <li>A laptop? Digital camera? Scout can help you find tools that are supported by the Student Technology Fee.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Scout UW has you covered.</p>

        <p>Scout UW will help you find resources on all three UW campuses and is made possible by UW-IT and the Student Technology Fee.</p>
